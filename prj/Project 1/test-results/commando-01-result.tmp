(TEST 1) Startup, Help, Exit, and List Built-in
COMMENTS:
Checks whether commando starts up, shows the 'help' message, runs the
'list' built-in which should produce empty output then exits.


program: ./commando --echo
Failure messages:
- FAILURE(139) due to Kill Signal from OS: likely a SEGFAULT occured
- FAILURE: Valgrind reports reachable memory, may need to add free() or fclose()
- FAILURE: Output Mismatch at lines marked

--- Side by Side Differences ---
- Expect output in: test-results/raw/commando-01-expect.tmp
- Actual output in: test-results/raw/commando-01-actual.tmp
- Differing lines have a character like '|' '>' or '<' in the middle
