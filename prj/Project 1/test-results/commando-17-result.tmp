COMMENTS:
Starts several jobs then pauses; longer running jobs should not finish
during the initial 'pause' but should finish after a 'wait-all'.

Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this        <
continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the     <
proposition that all men are created equal.                             <
                                                                        <
Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation,   <
or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are    <
met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a     <
portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here      <
gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting  <
and proper that we should do this.                                      <
                                                                        <
But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate -- we can not consecrate    <
-- we can not hallow -- this ground. The brave men, living and dead,    <
who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to    <
add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we   <
say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the  <
living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they  <
who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us    <
to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- that      <
from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for    <
which they gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here       <
highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain -- that      <
this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom -- and that   <
government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not      <
perish from the earth.                                                  <
