(TEST 18) wait-for individual jobs
COMMENTS:
Checks that wait-for waits for individual commands, not all running
commands. Output for the different 'sleep' commands becomes available
at different times in the below which can be coordinated by the
'wait-for' builtin.


program: ./commando --echo
Failure messages:
- FAILURE(139) due to Kill Signal from OS: likely a SEGFAULT occured
- FAILURE: Valgrind reports reachable memory, may need to add free() or fclose()
- FAILURE: Output Mismatch at lines marked

--- Side by Side Differences ---
- Expect output in: test-results/raw/commando-18-expect.tmp
- Actual output in: test-results/raw/commando-18-actual.tmp
- Differing lines have a character like '|' '>' or '<' in the middle
