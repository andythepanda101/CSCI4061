(TEST 15) pause finishes single job
COMMENTS:
Pause should allow short jobs like 'cat' to finish


program: ./commando --echo
Failure messages:
- FAILURE(139) due to Kill Signal from OS: likely a SEGFAULT occured
- FAILURE: Valgrind reports reachable memory, may need to add free() or fclose()
- FAILURE: Output Mismatch at lines marked

--- Side by Side Differences ---
- Expect output in: test-results/raw/commando-15-expect.tmp
- Actual output in: test-results/raw/commando-15-actual.tmp
- Differing lines have a character like '|' '>' or '<' in the middle
