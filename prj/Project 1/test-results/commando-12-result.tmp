Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this                        <
continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the                     <
proposition that all men are created equal.                                             <

Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation,                   <
or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are                    <
met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a                     <
portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here                      <
gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting                  <

-- we can not hallow -- this ground. The brave men, living and dead,                    <
who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to                    <
add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we                   <
say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the                  <
living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they                  <
who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us                    <
to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- that                      <
from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for                    <
which they gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here                       <
highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain -- that                      <
this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom -- and that                   <
